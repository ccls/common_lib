added 'protected_attributes' gem

had to add attr_accessible lists
or attr_protected with nothing

changed Bundler statement

changed 'match' routes to 'get'

need to set rows and cols for text areas?

text fields no longer have size set by default (and is not required?)


removed from environments files
	config.whiny_nils = true # not in rails 4
	config.active_record.mass_assignment_sanitizer = :strict # not in rails 4
	config.active_record.auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds = 0.5 # not in rails 4
	config.action_dispatch.best_standards_support = :builtin


add to environments files
	config.eager_load is set to nil. Please update your config/environments/*.rb files accordingly:

  * development - set it to false
  * test - set it to false (unless you use a tool that preloads your test environment)
  * production - set it to true



simple_cov coverage only seems to cover the app stuff now.
need to investigate



testing (autotest at least) is picking up EVERYTHING in the entire directory structure that matches "test_*"


also seems to load all ruby in my "archive" dirs.  Not sure if this is just testing.
