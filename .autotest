#	FYI, "complex" pluralized names in fixtures don't get mapped correctly.
#		counties, people, etc.

#	app/helpers/*rb don't get mapped to tests either.
#	helpers may need to be moved from test/unit/helpers/ to test/helpers/
#	make more sense anyway.
#	same with app/mailers/ to.  Move test/functional/MAILER_TESTS to test/mailers/
