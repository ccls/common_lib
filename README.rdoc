= CCLS Common Lib

After further pondering, I think that I'm just going to fork all of the jakewendt repo/gems into ccls and then to use the ccls-* gem instead.

This will probably not endure any further development, but I'm leaving it just in case.

This ruby gem ( ccls-common_lib ) is meant to include all of the current functionality provided by ...

* {jakewendt-ruby_extension}[http://github.com/jakewendt/ruby_extension] - modifications, updates and patches for ruby.
* {jakewendt-simply_helpful}[http://github.com/jakewendt/simply_helpful]
* {jakewendt-simply_authorized}[http://github.com/jakewendt/simply_authorized]
* {jakewendt-simply_pages}[http://github.com/jakewendt/simply_pages]
* {jakewendt-rails_extension}[http://github.com/jakewendt/rails_extension]
